YOLO Model by Ultralytics:
This project uses the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model, developed by Ultralytics, for object detection.
The YOLO model from Ultralytics is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 License.
You can find more information about Ultralytics on the official website: https://docs.ultralytics.com/

The model has been trained to recognize four different car brands. The recognition results of the YOLOv8 model are then stored in the shared memory, which enables fast communication between the processes. Further data processing is not shown in this repository.
